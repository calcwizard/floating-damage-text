floating-damage-string-format=Formatting for the text displayed when an entity is damaged.\nThis uses the same formatting as C's printf function.  The first argument is the damage dealt; the second argument is the damage type.  It is recommended to use %s for both specifiers.  See the FAQ on the mod portal page for more information.  Can be set empty to not display anything.\nDefault: %s
floating-number-rounding=Number of digits after the decimal point to round to.  Negative numbers round to powers of 10.\n[-6 : 2 : 6]

floating-enemy-damage-color=Color text of damaged enemies (biters, spawners, and worms)\nFormat is r,g,b where r, g, and b are each a number between 0 and 255.  If all values are <= 1, it is interpreted on a scale between 0 and 1.\nDefault: 200,0,0
