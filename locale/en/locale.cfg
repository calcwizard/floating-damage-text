[mod-setting-description]
floating-damage-string-format=The format string uses Lua's string.format specifiers, which are identical to C's printf.  The arguments are delimited by %specifier (eg %f for a float and %s for a string). The first argument is the amount of damage; the second argument is the damage type.\nDefault: %.4g
floating-integer-rounding=The method used to round integers.\n"Nearest Integer" rounds to the nearest integer, with < .5 rounding down and >= .5 rounding up.  "Floor" always rounds down and "Ceiling" always rounds up.\nDefault: Nearest Integer  
floating-ally-damage-color=Color text of damaged allies (characters, cars, and tanks)\nFormat is r,g,b where r, g, and b are each a number between 0 and 255.  If all values are <= 1, it is interpreted on a scale between 0 and 1.\nDefault: 255,127,0
floating-enemy-damage-color=Color text of damaged enemies (biters, spawners, worms)\nFormat is r,g,b where r, g, and b are each a number between 0 and 255.  If all values are <= 1, it is interpreted on a scale between 0 and 1.\nDefault: 200,0,0
floating-neutral-damage-color=Color text of damaged neutral entities (neither ally nor enemy)\nFormat is r,g,b where r, g, and b are each a number between 0 and 255.  If all values are <= 1, it is interpreted on a scale between 0 and 1.\nDefault: 200,200,200
